# Assignment 3 – Math Operations in Python

## Description
This repository contains Python programs that demonstrate the use of the `math` module and recursion.  
The programs perform basic mathematical operations such as calculating square root, logarithm, sine, and factorial of a number entered by the user.

## Programs Included

### 1. Math Operations Program
This program:
- Takes an integer input from the user
- Calculates and displays:
  - Square root of the number
  - Natural logarithm of the number
  - Sine of the number (in radians)
- Uses the built-in `math` module for these calculations

### 2. Factorial Program
This program:
- Takes an integer input from the user
- Calculates the factorial of the number using a recursive function
- Displays the result in the format:  
  `Factorial of x is: result`

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. Open a terminal in the project folder.
4. Run the Python file using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
